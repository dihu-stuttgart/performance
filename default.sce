# Scenario file for cuboid example
#
# Comment (sub-)lines start with # or !
# Specify assignments as Variable=Value, logical values as `T` or `F`.
# Variables are case-insensitive, whitespace between specifiers is ignored.
# Pass this file's name to cuboid as command argument. It must end in .sce and can be mixed with the usual arguments which are:
# ./cuboid <input folder> <X> <Y> <Z> <F> <A> <ODESolverId> <MonodomainSolverId> <MonodomainPreconditionerId>
# where X,Y,Z = NumberGlobal{X,Y,Z}Elements, A = NumberOfElementsInAtomicPortionPerDomain, F = NumberOfInSeriesFibres
# Command line arguments can also be an assignment, like `DebuggingOutput=T` or `X=1`.
# The command line arguments are processed in the order they occur, when this file appears, all its assignments are parsed.
# Therefore values can be overwritten when the filename is the first argument.
